Final Exam mini project


## Creative Thinking

  * Use MVP architecture as its clean architecture to support clean code, with the view layer and the presenter layer merged (to simplify the project complexity)
  * `OnlineNewsManager extends Vector<News>` in order to make a "cache" data of the latest query
  * Use `utils/*` as helper classes
